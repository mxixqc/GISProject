### Introduction

There has been a decrease in birth rates in Singapore, hence leading to fewer numbers of enrollments for schools. In 2019, MOE conducted a merging exercise, where 14 primary schools were selected to merge based on enrollment trends, proximity to new sites and infrastructural capabilities of the receiving schools. 

In this project, we will be focusing on the mergers of primary schools in 2019. 

Here are some information that we found interesting!
