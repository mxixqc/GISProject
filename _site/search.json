    "text": "Our Motivation\n\n\nThe merging of 2 schools is not always a happy occasion for many students. For some students, they often end up travelling for longer hours, leading to less time to relax and enjoy.\nAs SMU students, we wanted to explore the impact of the merger of educational institutions (i.e Primary and Secondary schools) to find out whether it is easier for students to access their schools after a merger.\nThrough our findings, we hope to provide recommendations on how the merger of schools can be improved in terms of ease of access, for students. We do this in the hopes of making their commute a more pleasant experience.\n\n\n\nScope of Work\n\n\nOur team has decided to work on Primary schools in Singapore.\n\n\n\nProject Schedule"
