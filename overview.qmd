## Overview

There has been a decrease in birth rates in Singapore, hence leading to fewer numbers of enrollments for schools. In 2019, MOE conducted a [merging exercise](https://www.moe.gov.sg/news/press-releases/20171229-names-of-primary-and-secondary-schools-merging-in-2019), where 7 pairs of primary schools and 3 pairs of secondary schools.

These were some factors that were considered for the merger of schools:

-   Schools' history and heritage

-   enrollments

-   stakeholders' interests

-   sentiments of all schools involved

In our project, we aim to focus on Primary Schools and how the distance from a residential building to the newly merged primary school had been affected.

## Project Tasks

#### The project Tasks are as follows:

1.  Explore the available literature
2.  Obtain Pre-Merger Data
3.  Obtain Post-Merger Data
4.  Understand the Impacts of Primary School Merger on Accessibility
5.  Identify Top Affected Areas
6.  Propose potential on how to minimize impacts
