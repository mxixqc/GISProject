### Methodology

#### Data Preparation for Distance Matrix 

a.  Subzone boundary data can be extracted from data.gov.sg → master plan 2014 subzone boundary (<https://data.gov.sg/dataset/master-plan-2014-subzone-boundary-no-sea> )

b.  Import the kml MP14_SUBZONE_NO_SEA_PL file and save it into geopackage, converting the CRS to EPSG3414/ SVY21. Rename it as \'MP14 subzone\'.

#### Data Extraction for Schools from Online Sources

####  2019 data

i.  Location of schools extracted from data.gov.sg (<https://data.gov.sg/dataset/school-directory-and-information> ) → general-information-of-schools.csv

ii. Since general-information-of-schools.csv does not contain latitude or longitude data/ coordinate data, geocoding using the plugin MMQGIS needs to be done. Before geocoding, open the csv in excel and add 2 more columns \'City\' and \'Singapore\' and fill both columns with \'Singapore\'. Save changes and rename the csv to \'schools_info.csv\'.

iii. Download the MMQGIS plugin on QGIS and navigate to Geocode \> Geocode CSV with web service. Select schools_info.csv for input CSV file, and OpenStreetMap/ Nominatim for geocoding web service. For output file name create a new folder \'found\' to save geocoded shapefile. For the Not Found output list, name it not-found.csv.

     ![](images/Project%20Website%20%20(1).fld/image001.png)

iv. The resulting \'found.shp\' should contain only 324 records once loaded onto the layers panel. Open the attribute table and select the primary schools using these queries using the Select by expression icon

    ![](images/Project%20Website%20%20(1).fld/image003.png)

v.  Save the selected features as csv (Export \> Save selected features as). Name it \'priAll19-173\'

vi. Open the not-found.csv file, copy over the details of the following primary schools into \'priAll19-173.csv\'. As for the column \'latlong\', for each of the following primary schools, retrieve the latlong coordinates from google maps.\
    ![](images/Project%20Website%20%20(1).fld/image010.jpg)

vii. Separate the latlong data into 2 columns \'lat\' and \'long\'. Select the \'latlong\' column, Data \> text to columns \> choose the delimiter as comma. 2 new columns \'lat\' and \'long\' should be created. Save this csv named \'priAll19.csv\'.

viii. Import  \'priAll19.csv\' into QGIS (layer \> add layer \> add delimited text layer ) and input the following detail\

      ![](images/Project%20Website%20%20(1).fld/image011.png)\

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
ix. Save the layer priAll19 into geopackage format with the CRS EPSG3414![](images/Project%20Website%20%20(1).fld/image014.jpg)

#### 2017 data

i.  Download 2017 primary school locations from (<https://github.com/hxchua/datadoubleconfirm/blob/master/datasets/primaryschoolsg.csv> )

ii. It should contain the 7 schools that were merged into other schools in 2019

    ![](images/Project%20Website%20%20(1).fld/image016.jpg)

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
iii. Save it into geopackage with EPSG3414 projection, and named \'priAll17\'.

#### Data extraction for residential buildings from online sources 

a.  Download the shapefile from Geofabrik (<https://download.geofabrik.de/asia/malaysia-singapore-brunei.html> ) → malaysia-singapore-brunei-latest-free.shp.zip

b.  import the file \'gis_osm_buildings_a\_free_1.shp\' into QGIS

c.  Clip the buildings that fall within singapore (vector \> geoprocessing tools \> clip). For input layer, select \'gis_osm_buildings_a\_free_1\' layer. For overlay layer, select \'MP14 subzone\'.

d.  A new temporary layer \'Clipped\' should be added to layers panel. Open the attribute table, and select the residential type buildings. Save this layer into geopackage as \'Residential-buildings\'.

    ![](images/Project%20Website%20%20(1).fld/image018.jpg)

e.  To get residential building centroids[\[1\]](#_msocom_1) , use the plugin RealCentroid. For polygon layer, select \'Residential-buildings\'. For output point on surface layer, create a folder and name the output file \'residential-centroids\'. Save the newly created layer to geopackage named \'Resid-centroid\'.

####  Distance matrix for all merged schools

a.  From the priAll17 layer, select 14 schools affected by the 2019 merger (​​<https://www.moe.gov.sg/-/media/files/news/press/2017/annex-a---named-of-pri-and-sec-schools-merging-in-2019.pdf> ). Save these selected features to geopackage named \'mergedPri\'.
